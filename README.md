# Custom Command Plugin for Wox 2

A simple and flexible Wox 2 plugin that allows you to define custom shell commands, scripts, or actions via a JSON file. Trigger commands with aliases or keywords directly from Wox!

## ðŸš€ Features

- Map custom shell commands to Wox keywords
- Support for CMD, PowerShell, and custom executables
- Lightweight and easy to configure
- Supports parameterized inputs

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Go to the Wox plugin directory:
    - macOS: `~/.wox/wox-user/plugins/`
    - Windows/Linux: 'no idea'

2. Go to release page and download the latest version of the plugin

3. Extract the contents of the ZIP file into a new folder named `CustomCommand` in the Wox plugin directory.

4. Restart Wox.

## ðŸ”§ Configuration
1. Open the `CustomCommand` folder in the Wox plugin directory.
2. Edit the `shortcuts.json` file to define your custom commands. (You can use @ shortcut in Wox to open the file directly)

### Ex:
```json
[
  {
    "shortcut": "Gitlab",
    "script": "open 'https://gitlab.com/search?scope=merge_requests&search=$@'",
    "description": "Search merge requests in Gitlab $@"
  },
  {
    "shortcut": "Random",
    "script": "say $((RANDOM % $1))",
    "description": "Generate a random number between 0 and $1"
  }
]
```

You can use `$@` to pass all arguments and `$1`, `$2`, etc. to pass specific arguments. The script can be a shell command, PowerShell command, or a path to an executable.

You will need to restart Wox after making changes to the `shortcuts.json` file for them to take effect.
